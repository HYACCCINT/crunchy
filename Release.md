# Release.md

For every task in our projects, weâ€™ve created issues in Zenhub and close them after merging corresponding PRs. For smaller PRs, we require 2 approvals from teammates and for design related larger PRs, we require all members to have read through and approve of the PR, before it can be merged. 
The only time we allowed direct commits instead of PRs, was when initializing the project folders and creating an empty React app, all other commits require opening a pull request. There should **never** be a case where a PR is merged without review.
